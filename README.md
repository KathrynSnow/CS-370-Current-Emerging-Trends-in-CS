Work Created and Work Given
We created the Q-learning algorithm to solve the path finding problem.  The code creating the maze, the pirate and moves were provided.  

How Do I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist?
I approach a problem with the end in mind, like the psuedo-code.  I start with a clear idea of what the end result might look loke.  From there I fill in the steps to reach that result.  I used the word might because along the way I may find problems or better solutions that were not obvious in the beginning.  I work towards an end result needs a target in order to stay on task and on time.  I refine as I make corrections until the creation meets my expectation, the end result.

What Are My Ethical Responsibilities to Both the End User and the Organization?
I believe that NO Harm and Respect are two similar guides for anything you do in life.  Our world is diverse and the way forward to harm no one is challenging.  Therefore, following the law is step one.  But we need stronger laws.  Laws that do not wait for a problem to be created.  The EU has the right ideas to protect humans from bad actors.  A GDPR type law is necessay.  I would hope to work for a company who holds my same belief so that the organiztion is about repecting the user and the world.  Bad actors using the product would be given the opportunity to change or released from any contract and lose access to the product.
